## About Me
Hello, I'm Jonathan! I am a Junior in high school near Charlotte, North Carolina. I am also a student at the North Carolina School of Science and Math as an online student. In addition to my studies, I love software development and have worked on two Android applications with the NCVirtual Coding Club, (College Atlas)[https://devpost.com/software/college-atlas-gzkhbx] and (Rise)[https://devpost.com/software/rise-o6bpyx]. I am currently learning react and working on several personal projects.
